Hello, my name is Oswal Gonzalez and I am an aspiring software developer. I currently attend Seattle Central College where I am pursuing a Software Development Certification. I am also stuyding Business Communications because I beleive that having those skills will help me stand out and be successful in my future career. 
When I am not studying I keep myself busy with hobbies that keep me active, whether that be playing sports like soccer or tennis, hiking or kayaking or even photography. 
I am someone that really values friends and family and self improvment. I believe that you should always work hard at your goals but also work hard on improving yourself peronally in order to become the best version of yourself. 
I have a few years of experience in the workforce and I have shaped the skills I learned at these past jobs to make skillset unique.
